# Solvent AI

Solvent AI is a **smart, hierarchical AI assistant** designed to seamlessly switch between cloud-based reasoning (Gemini Pro/Vision) and local privacy-focused models (Ollama/Qwen).

## 🚀 Features

- **Smart Router:** Automatically routes queries between Gemini (Cloud) and Ollama (Local) based on complexity, availability, and user mode.
- **Deep Thought Mode:** Enforces a "Chain of Thought" reasoning process for complex queries.
- **Graph Extraction:** Visualizes relationships in your data by extracting knowledge graphs from AI responses.
- **Browser Mode:** Injects real-time search results (via Serper) into the context for up-to-date answers.
- **Vision Support:** Multimodal capabilities using Gemini Vision.
- **Async Task Infrastructure:** Redis-backed queue system for handling high-latency operations like project indexing and memory maintenance.
- **Plugin Architecture:** Dynamic plugin system for extending AI providers and tools without modifying core code.

## 🏗 Architecture

This project is structured as a monorepo:

- **`frontend/`**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS application. Features a modern "Bento" UI and interactive graph visualization.
- **`backend/`**: Node.js + Express + TypeScript API. Handles API routing, prompt engineering, and service orchestration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Lucide React, Zustand (Store)
- **Backend:** Express, Zod (Validation), Dotenv
- **AI Services:** Google Gemini API, Ollama (Local), Serper.dev (Search)
